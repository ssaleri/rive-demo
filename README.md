# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`] + Rive native module.

Reference: https://docs.expo.dev/modules/third-party-library/

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the ios app
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --platform ios
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   ```
   
4. If you are running Metro server with Expo Go, Press 's' in Metro server terminal to switch to Development build (native modules aren't compatible with Expo Go)


## Troubleshooting:
The very first time, you may need to build the iOS app from xCode to your iOS simulator.
